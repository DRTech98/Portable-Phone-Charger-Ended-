# Portable Phone Charger (Work In Progress)
A phone charger I designed through Ki-CAD that includes the schematic, board layout, and custom footprints used for pads to attach the lithium ion battery. Circuit includes a charging port controller, boost converter, and an LED driver to display the battery percentage of the charger through surface mount LEDs. Layout is a double sided PCB mainly composed of surface mount components with a micro USB port for the charger and a USB A port to charge Apple and Android devices. Project is currently still in development, PCB has not been prototyped yet through JLC PCB. Project needs a BOM along with a report disccussing the thought process behind my design.
