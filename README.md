# Portable Phone Charger (WIP)
A phone charger I designed through Ki-CAD that includes the schematic, board layout, and custom footprints used for pads to attach the lithium ion battery. Circuit includes a charging port controller, boost converter, and an LED driver to display the battery percentage of the charger through surface mount LEDs. Layout is a double sided PCB mainly composed of surface mount components with a micro USB port for the charger and a USB A port to charge Apple and Android devices. Project is currently still in development and is missing the following:

1. Bill of Materials (BOM).
2. Reprot discussing my thought process behind the design.
3. PCB prototypes from JLC PCB.
4. Datasheets of components used for the project. 
5. Pictures and videos showing the prototype and how it works.
